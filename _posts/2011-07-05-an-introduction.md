A post!  A first post!  Welcome to the REDD Metrics blog.  We will use
this platform to blog about topics as far-flung as spatial
econometrics, Python, environmental policy, Clojure, cloud compuation, among
others, while we develop new products that are intended to support
environmental conservation.

We will post code and applications, project updates and compact data
analysis. We are not a big group, but we are all committed to making
our work useful to other researchers.

Thanks for visiting!
