The rate of forest clearing activity detected by FORMA in Burma (Myanmar) has been increasing steadily in recent years.  Check out the time-series graph below, which display both the  monthly rate of forest clearing and rainfall between January 2006 and December 2010.  For now, the forest clearing rate is tagged to a unitless index.  We don't want to publish precise areal estimates -- not even on this ragtag blog -- until we have done our due diligence in double-checking the results.

We will have updates soon through June 2011. We have done preliminary analysis on the shifting patterns of regional deforestation in Southeast Asia.  Forest clearing has shifted in the past few years, it seems, away from Indonesia and toward the coastal states of Irrawaddy and Rakhine in Burma.  But we can't really explain why forest clearing rates are picking up in coastal Burma.  Can someone tell us what's going on?
