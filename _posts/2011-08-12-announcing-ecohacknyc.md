<p class="meta">12 August, 2011 - Robin Kraft</p>

\[Note: This was ghost written by a certain REDD Metrics colleague. Fifty points if you can tell which one.\]

My name is Robin Kraft and I'm a huge nerd.  I'll admit that.*  \(Incidentally, I'll also admit here that [Dan](http://www.reddmetrics.com/aboutus.html) is way cooler than I am.\)  And in so doing, I would like to announce [EcoHackNYC](http://www.EcoHackNYC.org), an unconference for our community of sci/data/hackers passionate about understanding global environmental change.

We are working with the very talented dudes at [Vizzuality](http://www.vizzuality.com/), who will be providing space for nerding out about, and hacking environmental data in early November. We'll be starting on Friday, November 4 with 5-minute proposals for projects the next day, and socializing of course. Then we'll reconvene the next morning to start a day of hacking.

Please visit [EcoHackNYC](http://www.EcoHackNYC.org) to sign up if you're interested! We'll have more details there soon. 

I hope to see you there!
