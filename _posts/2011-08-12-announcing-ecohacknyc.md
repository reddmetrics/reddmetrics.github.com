<p class="meta">12 August, 2011 - Robin Kraft</p>

\[Note: This was ghost written by a certain REDD Metrics colleague. Fifty points if you can tell which one.\]

My name is [Robin Kraft](https://twitter.com/#!/robinkraft) and I'm a huge nerd.  I'll admit that.*  \(Incidentally, I'll also admit here that [Dan Hammer](http://www.reddmetrics.com/aboutus.html) is way cooler than I am.\)  And in so doing, I would like to announce [EcoHackNYC](http://www.EcoHackNYC.org), an unconference in early November for our community of sci/data/hackers passionate about understanding global environmental change.

[Javier de la Torre](https://twitter.com/#!/jatorre) and [Andrew Hill](https://twitter.com/#!/andrewxhill), two of the very talented dudes at [Vizzuality](http://www.vizzuality.com/), are co-organizers and graciously providing meeting space at their NY lair/office. We'll start things off on Friday, November 4 with 5-minute lightning proposals for hackery the next day, followed by rooftop socializing, of course. We'll reconvene Saturday morning to start hacking.

Please visit [EcoHackNYC.org](http://www.EcoHackNYC.org) for more info and to sign up! We'll have more details there soon.

We hope to see you there!

p.s. For those who have to sell this to your boss, [Hadoop World 2011](http://www.hadoopworld.com/) is happening the following week.
