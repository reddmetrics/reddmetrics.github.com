Two months ago, the New York Times reported on the rapid rate of peatland forest clearing in Northern Borneo. The [Green Blog](http://goo.gl/kq286) featured the incredible work of researchers at [SarVision](http://www.sarvision.nl/), which found that 33 percent of coastal peatland forest in the Malaysian state of Sarawak has been cleared since 2005.  Good gracious!  We have embedded the SarVision data below  Below, we have displayed the SarVision [data](http://goo.gl/yQfQQ) in Google Earth, with clearing since 2005 displayed in yellow (2005-2006) through red (2009-2010).  We have turned the FORMA system to the same geographic extent.  FORMA allows for more rapid updates (monthly) but at lower spatial resolution.  You can download the slides [here](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5365589/sarawak.pdf.zip) (PDF.zip, 6.8MB).  If you flip through the PDF slides, you can watch the clearing spread from December 2005 through December 2010.  In light brown, we have displayed our training data set, which is (for this application) the Forest Cover Loss Hotspot data set published by Hansen, et al. (2008) for the full tropics (2000-2005).
