The New York Times recently reported on the rapid rate of peatland forest clearing in Northern Borneo. The [Green Blog](http://goo.gl/kq286) featured the incredible work of researchers at [SarVision](http://www.sarvision.nl/), who found that 33 percent of coastal peatland forest in the Malaysian state of Sarawak had been cleared since 2005.  Their map of clearing activity through time is displayed below in Google Earth; their raw data can be found [here](http://goo.gl/yQfQQ).  The green area is forest; yellow, orange, and red polygons indicate deforestation, 2005-2010.   This high spatial resolution data is indispensable to specify conservation policy.
</br>

We built FORMA to complement this work with monthly updates at lower spatial resolution.  Currently, the FORMA system is operational at 1km resolution, with planned improvements to 250m resolution.  We are now able to aim the FORMA system at the Sarawak region, animating the monthly spread of clearing activity.  A video of the animation is embedded below, or you can download the slides ([PDF.zip](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5365589/sarawak.pdf.zip), 6.8MB).
