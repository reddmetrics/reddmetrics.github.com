A post!  A first post!  Welcome to reddMetrics.blog, a forum devoted to writings on programming, environmental policy, and spatial econometrics.  We will use this platform to blog about topics as far-flung as policy evaluation, Clojure, Python, forest monitoring, cloud computation, resource economics, machine learning, and spatial analysis, among other things, while we develop new products that are intended to facilitate environmental conservation.

But first, a brief introduction.  REDD Metrics, LLC, was formed in early 2011 to refine and enhance a few incipient products that we hope will inform environmental policy analysis.  The current members - Darius, Sam, Robin, and me (Dan) - are the founding members, and we're really excited about this work!

Robin and I originally began working together on the [FORMA](http://www.cgdev.org/forma) project under the guidance of [David Wheeler](http://www.cgdev.org/content/expert/detail/11584), at the [Center for Global Development](http://www.cgdev.org), an economics think tank in Washington, DC. FORMA is a tool for forest monitoring that generates monthly estimates of tropical forest clearing activity (currently) at 1km spatial resolution.  The system is operational for Southeast Asia, and all FORMA data are made public.  We will be posting here on updates from the FORMA system, highlighting data sets and associated analysis that we think are particularly interesting.

Robin and I teamed up with Darius and Sam to develop additional platforms and products, some of which use the public FORMA data as a raw data source.  Darius is leading the effort to construct products that may be useful to large environmental groups or financial institutions. Sam is leading development of the core processing platform, using a coordinated mix of Hadoop and Clojure.
