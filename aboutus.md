			<p><FONT COLOR="#a00">Dan Hammer</FONT> (<a style="text-decoration:none" href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5365589/hammer-cv.pdf">CV</a>) is a founding member and research analyst at REDD Metrics, specializing in spatial statistics and natural resource economics.  Dan graduated from Swarthmore College in 2007 with high honors in mathematics and economics. He was a Lang Scholar and a Watson Fellow, and he passed the swim test with the grace of a cuttlefish.  Dan is now a researcher and consultant at Resource for the Future, the World Bank, and the Center for Global Development, while he completes a master's degree in geospatial information sciences from the University of Maryland.  Next year, he will begin a PhD in resource economics and another master's in statistics at UC Berkeley. </p>

			<p><FONT COLOR="#a00">Robin Kraft</FONT> can't compose in his head.  He needs to type out his bio. Are you transcribing what I'm saying?  Godammit, Dan, let me do this.  Robin wishes he could groove like Dan.  Move, Dan, I'm typing.  No, Robin likes Dan's pants.  Ok, fine, that's true.  Robin is a man of many talents, and is quick on the uptake on languages - programming or otherwise.  He studied International Development at Sciences Po in Paris and History at Berkeley.  He desperately wants to move back to the West Coast, where he will join Dan, Sam, and the rest of his immediate family. </p>

			<p><FONT COLOR="#a00">Sam Ritchie</FONT> is a founding member and lead developer at REDD Metrics.  But, first and foremost, he is my friend and carnal companion.  His ultimate goal is to build a tiny house on wheels to park on the street in Berkeley.  If he could do anything, he would learn to drink whiskey out of straws, eat kumquats out of angels' bellybuttons.  But he can't do anything, and so he remains -- pinned to this earth like a donkey's tail at a Phillies game.</p>
