			<p><FONT COLOR="#a00">Dan Hammer</FONT> is, like, probably the coolest person I know.  He is handsome and pretty all at once - and oh-so-dreamy, too.  Dan is a founding member and research analyst at REDD Metrics, specializing in spatial econometrics and natural resource economics. His ultimate goal is to master the art of geriatrics while spinning plates.  Still, he is able to diffuse Rubiks bombs with his light and loose pinky fingers.  He is friends with Sam and Robin.  This is his greatest accomplishment.  At least until he learns how to spin plates.  Yessah! </p>

			<p><FONT COLOR="#a00">Darius Nassiry</FONT> is a founding member of REDD Metrics and a visiting fellow at the Center for Global Development, where he focuses on financing climate change mitigation and adaptation.

Prior to MCC, Darius focused on corporate finance and mergers and acquisitions advice for energy and utilities companies in the U.S., UK, Europe and Japan.

			<p><FONT COLOR="#a00">Robin Kraft</FONT> can't compose in his head.  He needs to type out his bio. Are you transcribing what I'm saying?  Godammit, Dan, let me do this.  Robin wishes he could groove like Dan.  Move, Dan, I'm typing.  No, Robin likes Dan's pants.  Ok, fine, that's true.  Robin is a man of many talents, and is quick on the uptake on languages - programming or otherwise.  He studied International Development at Sciences Po in Paris and History at Berkeley.  He desperately wants to move back to the West Coast, where he will join Dan, Sam, and the rest of his immediate family. </p>

			<p><FONT COLOR="#a00">Sam Ritchie</FONT> is a founding member and lead developer at REDD Metrics.  But, first and foremost, he is my friend and carnal companion.  His ultimate goal is to build a tiny house on wheels to park on the street in Berkeley.  If he could do anything, he would learn to drink whiskey out of straws, eat kumquats out of angels' bellybuttons.  But he can't do anything, and so he remains -- pinned to this earth like a donkey's tail at a Phillies game.</p>
